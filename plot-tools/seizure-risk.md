### Test Type Performed
Visual presents seizure risk.

### Artifact Evaluated
[Plot tools](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction/tools.html#ug-interaction-tools). Specifically, evaluating the interface icons that are used to access the tools that are in the [scatter plot](https://quansight-labs.github.io/bokeh-a11y-audit/#_ts1723552414769).

### Results Summary
Passes.

### Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)
- *PASS* - Plot tools do not pose a seizure risk

### Steps to Reproduce
Record screen while using interactive features and elements and then run that through PEAT testing tool. In addition, check against common heuristics from WCAG (number of flashes present on the screen per second, etc).

### Notes
<!-- A seasoned SR (screen reader) user could have the knowledge to navigate and explore webpages and graphs with more nuance, whether through manual mode switching, certain key shortcuts, etc. These tests are done by a sighted user with the SRâ€™s default options and performed as if a new or beginner user is interacting with these elements. We would expect that all users could be able to navigate smoothly, regardless of experience levels.  -->
