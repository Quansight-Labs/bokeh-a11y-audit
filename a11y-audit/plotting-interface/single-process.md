### Test Type Performed
Information can only be reached through single process. 

### Artifact Evaluated
[Plotting interface](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/basic.html#ug-basic). Specifically, evaluating the interfaces for all [charts](https://quansight-labs.github.io/bokeh-a11y-audit/#_ts1723552414769) in our test environment: line, bar, table and scatter plot.

### Results Summary
Plotting interface does not provide alternative means to change states outside of utilizing the plot tools or the content being visual.

### Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)
- *FAIL* - There must be more than one process available to reach the same information. If chart is contained within or participates in complex user interface flows, such as transitions between views or states, interacting with filters, or moving between pages, there must be alternative paths to reach that same state (such as with search features, table of contents, parallel UI controls, etc).

### Steps to Reproduce
Use Inspect on the plot tool icon to open Console Command. Find the "style" section for the selected button then locate the font size. -->

<!-- ### Notes
A seasoned SR (screen reader) user could have the knowledge to navigate and explore webpages and graphs with more nuance, whether through manual mode switching, certain key shortcuts, etc. These tests are done by a sighted user with the SRâ€™s default options and performed as if a new or beginner user is interacting with these elements. We would expect that all users could be able to navigate smoothly, regardless of experience levels. -->
