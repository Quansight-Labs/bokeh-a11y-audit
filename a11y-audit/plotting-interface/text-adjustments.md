### Test Type Performed

User's text adjustments are respected.

### Artifact Evaluated

[Plotting interface](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/basic.html#ug-basic). Specifically, evaluating the interfaces for all [charts](https://quansight-labs.github.io/bokeh-a11y-audit/#_ts1723552414769) in our test environment: line, bar, table and scatter plot.

### Results Summary

Plotting interface fails to allow users to adjust text, like text stroke, font, and/or font size.

### Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)

- _FAIL_ - Text spacing and font-size changed by the user must be respected. Chart must not interfere with programmatic changes to font sizes or text spacing, such as importing a custom style sheet or using a browserâ€™s build in zoom function. Font size and spacing must adjust accordingly.

The text on the web page has adjusted to an increased text stroke, but the chart space retains it's default settings -- no adjustments have been made. (fails)." src="./assets/plotting-interface_text-adjustments.png">

### Steps to Reproduce
