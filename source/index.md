# Bokeh Accessibility Audit

This website documents finding from an initial accessibility audit.

The audit focuses on a scoped set of Bokeh's interface and widgets gathered in this dashboard: [Bokeh dashboard for accessibility audit](https://quansight-labs.github.io/bokeh-a11y-audit/).

The audit is based on the [Chartability heuristics](https://chartability.fizz.studio/#what-is-chartability).
