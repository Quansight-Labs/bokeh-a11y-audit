# Color Contrast

## Test Type Performed

Color Contrast.

## Artifact Evaluated

[Plot tools](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction/tools.html#ug-interaction-tools). Specifically, evaluating the interface icons that are used to access the tools that are in the [scatter plot](https://quansight-labs.github.io/bokeh-a11y-audit/#_ts1723552414769).

## Results Summary

Plot tool icons fail minimum contrast. Results are 2.46:1.

## Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)

- _FAIL_ - We would expect interactive elements to pass a contrast ratio of either 4.5:1 for text or 3:1 for graphics.

## Image or Video of Failure

```

## Steps to Reproduce

Using a dropper tool to gather the color, compare the foreground color against the background color to calculate the contrast score.

In this particular case, we tested the full grey interior pixels of the icon against the full white background (avoiding aliased/partial pixels).

## Guidelines and Standards Used

Low contrast minimums [https://chartability.github.io/POUR-CAF/#**lowcontrast\_**critical\_](https://chartability.github.io/POUR-CAF/#__lowcontrast___critical_)

## Notes

<!-- A seasoned SR (screen reader) user could have the knowledge to navigate and explore webpages and graphs with more nuance, whether through manual mode switching, certain key shortcuts, etc. These tests are done by a sighted user with the SRâ€™s default options and performed as if a new or beginner user is interacting with these elements. We would expect that all users could be able to navigate smoothly, regardless of experience levels.  -->
