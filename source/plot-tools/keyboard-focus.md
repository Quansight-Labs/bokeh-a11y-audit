# Keyboard focus

## Test Type Performed

Keyboard focus indicator.

## Artifact Evaluated

[Plot tools](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction/tools.html#ug-interaction-tools). Specifically, evaluating the interface icons that are used to access the tools that are in the [scatter plot](https://quansight-labs.github.io/bokeh-a11y-audit/#_ts1723552414769).

## Results Summary

Plot tools fail for minimum contrast and border size for focus indicators. Results for contrast are 2.65:1 and 1.86:1 (respectively to image evidence below.) Result for focused border size is 1px.

## Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)

- _FAIL_ - We would expect focus indicators to pass a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 when focused or unfocused, and a border size of at least 2px.

## Steps to Reproduce

For focus border size: Take a screenshot of the plot tool when the focused border is active, then paste into Figma. Using a rectangle figure too, create a 1x1 pixel box and compare to screenshot border.

For color contrast: Using a dropper tool to gather the color, compare the foreground color against the background color to calculate the contrast score.

In this particular case, we tested the blue "selected" highlight of the icon against the full white background (1) and the blue "selected" highlight against the light-gray hover highlight (3). Avoiding aliased/partial pixels.

## Notes

NOTE: As of right now, Chartability requires 4.5:1 but we're using the more-lenient WCAG 2.2 3:1 requirements instead (Chartability will use this in the future anyway).
