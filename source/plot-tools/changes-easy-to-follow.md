# Changes Easy to Follow

## Test Type Performed

Changes are easy to follow.

## Artifact Evaluated

[Plot tools](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction/tools.html#ug-interaction-tools). Specifically, evaluating the interface icons that are used to access the tools that are in the [scatter plot](https://quansight-labs.github.io/bokeh-a11y-audit/#_ts1723552414769).

## Results Summary

Plot tools fail to convey the changes to the chart in a way that lets SR users (specifically) understand what is happening with their interactions.

## Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)

- _FAIL_ - The plot tools only offer visual feedback for any changes occurring in the chart. Although the tools currently cannot be accessed with a SR, I expect they would fail to announce the meaningful changes to the chart area.
  For example, when interacting with the scatterplot's tabs, there is so clear indication to SR users if their input worked or if changes occurred. The tabs also do not note what is currently selected when you renavigate to the "Selected Species" tab. The SR is simply announcing what the user has done, like pressing ENTER. (See video evidence below for example.)

## Image or Video of Failure

```{video} ./assets/plot-tools_changes-easy-to-follow.mp4
:width: 100%
:playsinline:
```

A scatter plot is shown. A screen reader is navigating through the chart's dropdown menu, but when an option is selected, the user is forced back to the top of the webpage. (fails).

## Steps to Reproduce

In this case, we cannot even activate the tools (such as the pan) with a screen reader. For the video example above, navigate to the scatter plot header. Use TAB to navigate to the chart. TAB until you get to the "Selected Species" tab. Press ENTER to open the menu, then select desired option and press ENTER again.

## Notes

A seasoned SR (screen reader) user could have the knowledge to navigate and explore webpages and graphs with more nuance, whether through manual mode switching, certain key shortcuts, etc. These tests are done by a sighted user with the SRâ€™s default options and performed as if a new or beginner user is interacting with these elements. We would expect that all users could be able to navigate smoothly, regardless of experience levels.
