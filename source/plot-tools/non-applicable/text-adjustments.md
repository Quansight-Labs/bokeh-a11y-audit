# Text Adjustments

## Test Type Performed
User's text adjustments are respected.

## Artifact Evaluated
[Plot tools](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction/tools.html#ug-interaction-tools). Specifically, evaluating the interface icons that are used to access the tools that are in the [scatter plot](https://quansight-labs.github.io/bokeh-a11y-audit/#_ts1723552414769).

## Results Summary
Test not applicable.
<!-- 
## Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)
- *FAIL* - We expect that any styling changes a user makes (contrast, text strokes, etc) are not blocked from taking effect, and the charts do no override these styling changes.

## Image or Video of Failure

    <img width="803" alt="A scatter plot is shown. A high contrast filter has been implemented, and the web browser background is black with yellow font. However, the chart space retains it's default color scheme - the contrast change was not applied (fails)." src="../assets/plot-tools_style-change-respected.png">
