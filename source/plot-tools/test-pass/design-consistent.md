# Design consistent

## Test Type Performed

Design is consistent and familiar.

## Artifact Evaluated

[Plot tools](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction/tools.html#ug-interaction-tools). Specifically, evaluating the interface icons that are used to access the tools that are in the [scatter plot](https://quansight-labs.github.io/bokeh-a11y-audit/#_ts1723552414769).

## Results Summary

Plot tools pass for design consistency and familiarity. The plot tools are the same from one chart to another. See "Notes" section below.

## Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)

- _Pass_ - We expect that any tools used by multiple charts would implement the same design and interactivity from one to another.

## Notes

This is a conditional pass due to the state the tools are currently in, but in general the same design happens across different chart types, browsers, devices, software, and OS.
