### Test Type Performed

Color is used alone to communicate meaning.

### Artifact Evaluated

[Annotations](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction.html): which include titles, axes labels, legends and their labels, color bar, span (i.e, line), text, and arrows.

### Results Summary

Annotations pass for giving multiple attributes to elements to communicate meaning (color, geometries, values, and/or text.)

### Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)

- _Pass_ - We expect charts to apply more than color alone to their elements, especially if those elements overlap or have close proximity. For categorical color schemes: Textures, shapes, or size (for filled elements) or dash patterns (for lines and paths) are required.
