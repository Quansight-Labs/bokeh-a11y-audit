### Test Type Performed
Controls are appropriate.

### Artifact Evaluated
[Annotations](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction.html): which include titles, axes labels, legends and their labels, colorbar, span (i.e, line), text, and arrows.

### Results Summary
Annotations pass for appropriate controls. 

### Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)
- *Pass* - All controls provided must not be irrelevant to the message, question, or task of the chart. Chart's interactive scope and functionality must not be too broad. The chart should if it can have irrelevant functionality removed.

<!-- ### Image or Video of Failure 
<video controls src="./assets/plot-tools_controls-inappropriate.mp4" title="Plot-tools_controls-inappropriate"></video>
A scatter plot is shown. The mouse cursor hovers over a plot tool called "Pan." Using the mouse, a user pans to the left of the chart (away from the visible data points) into an empty space. They pan to the right until the data points appear again. The user then uses the "Wheel  zoom" tool to zoom out until the data points become a small cluster, indistinguishable from one another before zooming in to where the data points disappear once again.

### Steps to Reproduce
Try to understand what the overall purpose of the visualization is, and then try to determine if the interactivity of the tools helps or assists with that purpose in any way. -->

We noted these same issues in the plot tools testing, but I wanted to reiterate them here.  -->
