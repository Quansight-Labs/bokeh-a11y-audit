# Metrics Variables

## Test Type Performed

Metrics and variables are defined.

## Artifact Evaluated

[Annotations](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction.html): which include titles, axes labels, legends and their labels, colorbar, span (i.e, line), text, and arrows.

## Results Summary

Annotations pass for defining metrics and variables of each chart. Note: All these components are visual only.

## Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)

- _Pass_ - Metrics or variables must not be misleading or undefined. Chart must not lie and data (and source) must be defined. Metadata, metrics, calculations, and variables must be defined.

<!-- ## Image or Video of Failure
<video controls src="./assets/plotting-interface_metrics-variables.mp4" title="Title"></video>
A line chart is shown. A screen reader begins to navigate down through a webpage to get to the chart. Once the user navigates to the chart, they are taken to the tools of the chart. No title, metrics, axes labels, etc are given to the user (fails).

## Steps to Reproduce
Using a SR, navigate to the chart space. Explore the chart space as needed.  -->
