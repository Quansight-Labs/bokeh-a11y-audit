### Test Type Performed

Axis labels are clear or present.

### Artifact Evaluated

[Annotations](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction.html): which include titles, axes labels, legends and their labels, colorbar, span (i.e, line), text, and arrows.

### Results Summary

Annotations pass for providing axis titles. Note: All these components are visual only.

### Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)

- _Pass_ - Axis labels should be present and clear. Axis must not be truncated without a clear label. In rare cases axes may be removed (if adequate text explanation or annotation is provided). Otherwise, axis should be present and clearly labeled. Axis labels may be abbreviated but with a clear and consistent convention.
