<!-- ### Notes
A seasoned SR (screen reader) user could have the knowledge to navigate and explore webpages and graphs with more nuance, whether through manual mode switching, certain key shortcuts, etc. These tests are done by a sighted user with the SRâ€™s default options and performed as if a new or beginner user is interacting with these elements. We would expect that all users could be able to navigate smoothly, regardless of experience levels.  -->
