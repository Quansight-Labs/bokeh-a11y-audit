### Test Type Performed

User's text adjustments are respected.

### Artifact Evaluated

[Annotations](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction.html): which include titles, axes labels, legends and their labels, colorbar, span (i.e, line), text, and arrows.[Plotting interface](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/basic.html#ug-basic). Specifically, evaluating the interfaces for all [charts](https://quansight-labs.github.io/bokeh-a11y-audit/#_ts1723552414769) in our test environment: line, bar, table and scatter plot.

### Results Summary

Annotations fails to allow users to adjust text, like text stroke, font, and/or font size. Only the hover tooltip respects the changes. 

### Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)

- _FAIL_ - Text spacing and font-size changed by the user must be respected. Chart must not interfere with programmatic changes to font sizes or text spacing, such as importing a custom style sheet or using a browserâ€™s build in zoom function. Font size and spacing must adjust accordingly.
