# Location History

## Test Type Performed

Location and history is clear.

## Artifact Evaluated

[Annotations](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction.html): which include titles, axes labels, legends and their labels, colorbar, span (i.e, line), text, and arrows.

## Results Summary

Test is not applicable.

<!-- ## Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)

- _FAIL_ - With interfaces that have altered views of charts, we would expect some way for the user to understand how they got to their current state.

- Current location in a system is not easy to understand. Similar to “more than one process” and “easy to share and reproduce,” current view and state of visualization (in a complex environment like a dashboard or app) must provide the user with breadcrumbs to guide their path as well as the ability to save, reload, and navigate history.

## Image or Video of Failure

<video controls src="./assets/plot-tools_complex-actions.mp4" title="Plot-tools_Complex-actions"></video>
A scatter plot is shown. The mouse cursor hovers over a plot tool called "Wheel Zoom." Using a mouse, a user zooms in and out on the chart space before clicking and panning away from the visible data points into an empty space. There is nothing on the screen that states any action history.

## Steps to Reproduce

Use any plot tools to interact with the chart to change it's view or state. -->

## Notes

This has carry-over from the plot tool testing since they are necessary to interact with the chart. -->
