### Test Type Performed
Scrolling experiences can be altered. 

### Artifact Evaluated
[Annotations](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction.html): which include titles, axes labels, legends and their labels, colorbar, span (i.e, line), text, and arrows.

### Results Summary
Test is not applicable. 

<!-- ### Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)
- *FAIL* - Scrolling experiences must provide a way to be adjusted or opted out of. Infinite scrolling, parallax scrolling, and “scrollytelling” experiences must come with the ability to be turned off or used optionally, with an option like “load more” or “next” in its place for keyboard only users.

<!-- ### Notes
A seasoned SR (screen reader) user could have the knowledge to navigate and explore webpages and graphs with more nuance, whether through manual mode switching, certain key shortcuts, etc. These tests are done by a sighted user with the SR’s default options and performed as if a new or beginner user is interacting with these elements. We would expect that all users could be able to navigate smoothly, regardless of experience levels. -->
