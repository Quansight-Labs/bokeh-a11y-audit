### Artifact Evaluated

[Annotations](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction.html): which include titles, axes labels, legends and their labels, colorbar, span (i.e, line), text, and arrows.

<p>A line chart, bar chart, and scatter plot are shown on a web browser. The user is selecting and deselecting tools rapidly to make the highlight color "flash". They then zoom in and out on each chart rapidly to check for any seizure risks (passes).</p>

### Steps to Reproduce

Record screen while using interactive features and elements and then run that through PEAT software. In addition, check against common heuristics from WCAG (number of flashes present on the screen per second, etc). -->

<!-- ### Notes
A seasoned SR (screen reader) user could have the knowledge to navigate and explore webpages and graphs with more nuance, whether through manual mode switching, certain key shortcuts, etc. These tests are done by a sighted user with the SRâ€™s default options and performed as if a new or beginner user is interacting with these elements. We would expect that all users could be able to navigate smoothly, regardless of experience levels.  -->
