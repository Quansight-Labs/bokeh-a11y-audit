# Complex Actions

## Test Type Performed

Complex actions have alternatives.

## Artifact Evaluated

[Annotations](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction.html): which include titles, axes labels, legends and their labels, colorbar, span (i.e, line), text, and arrows.

## Results Summary

Test is not applicable.

<!-- ## Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)
- *Pass* - Special actions (brushing/zooming/filtering/gesturing) that use custom or complex chart controls must have a standard UI alternative available. These controls must be clear and easy to use with a keyboard, screen reader, and touch device. -->

<!-- ## Image or Video of Failure
<video controls src="plot-tools_complex-actions.mp4" title="Title"></video> -->

<!-- ## Steps to Reproduce
In this case, we cannot even activate the tools (such as the wheel zoom) with a screen reader. Using a keyboard-only approach (no screen reader), it is possible to activate the wheel zoom tool but then using the wheel zoom is impossible without a mouse pointer. -->

## Guidelines and Standards Used

Complex actions have no alternatives [https://chartability.github.io/POUR-CAF/#**complexactionshavenoalternatives**](https://chartability.github.io/POUR-CAF/#__complexactionshavenoalternatives__)

## Notes

We cannot actually interact with the chart so we cannot test this fully.
