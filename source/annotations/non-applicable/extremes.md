### Test Type Performed

Space does not handle extremes.

### Artifact Evaluated

[Annotations](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction.html): which include titles, axes labels, legends and their labels, colorbar, span (i.e, line), text, and arrows.

### Results Summary

Test is not applicable.

<!-- ### Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)
- *FAIL* - Use of space should appropriately handle extreme difference or similarity in the data. Both extreme quantitative differences and similarities can produce unreadable charts. If chart elements are squished into margins due to outliers or together by too much similarity, this fails.
- Chart must automatically handle these issues or else it must be made clear to the user through annotations what is happening. If data is dynamic or producing automatic annotations is not possible, then chart must provide a way for the user to sort, divide, or filter the chart space on their own.

### Steps to Reproduce
Use Inspect on the plot tool icon to open Console Command. Find the "style" section for the selected button then locate the font size.

<!-- ### Notes
A seasoned SR (screen reader) user could have the knowledge to navigate and explore webpages and graphs with more nuance, whether through manual mode switching, certain key shortcuts, etc. These tests are done by a sighted user with the SRâ€™s default options and performed as if a new or beginner user is interacting with these elements. We would expect that all users could be able to navigate smoothly, regardless of experience levels.  -->
