### Test Type Performed

Data density is inappropriate (critical).

### Artifact Evaluated

[Annotations](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction.html): which include titles, axes labels, legends and their labels, colorbar, span (i.e, line), text, and arrows.

### Results Summary

Test is not applicable.

<!-- ### Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)
- *FAIL* - Data must be presented at an appropriate density. If more too many elements are competing for the same space (approximate limit is based on cognitive load): clustering or patterns (or lack of) must be explained, chart must be aggregated to a higher level with less elements, or chart must be divided into smaller charts with less data. Visual density should serve a purpose, such as retaining the data's signal (when appropriate).

<!-- ### Steps to Reproduce
Use Inspect on the plot tool icon to open Console Command. Find the "style" section for the selected button then locate the font size. -->

<!-- ### Notes
A seasoned SR (screen reader) user could have the knowledge to navigate and explore webpages and graphs with more nuance, whether through manual mode switching, certain key shortcuts, etc. These tests are done by a sighted user with the SRâ€™s default options and performed as if a new or beginner user is interacting with these elements. We would expect that all users could be able to navigate smoothly, regardless of experience levels.  -->
