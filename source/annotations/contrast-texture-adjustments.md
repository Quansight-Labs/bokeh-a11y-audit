### Test Type Performed
Contrast and textures can be adjusted.

### Artifact Evaluated
[Annotations](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction.html): which include titles, axes labels, legends and their labels, colorbar, span (i.e, line), text, and arrows.

### Results Summary
Annotations fail to respect a user's custom changing of contrast and/or textures. (See "Notes" section.)

The hover tooltip, however, does respect user changes.

### Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)
- *FAIL* - Contrast or textures must provide a way to be adjusted as-needed. Chart must not interfere with or override userâ€™s independent contrast adjustments and chart must adjust accordingly to new settings. Chart textures (such as those used on fills) must be able to be turned on or off according to user preference.
