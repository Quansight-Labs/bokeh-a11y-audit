# Conform to Standards

## Test Type Performed

Conform to standards.

The chart must conform to appropriate compliance standards. The chart must pass all relevant WCAG 2.1, Section 508, or equivalent requirements where applicable. (This is intended as an automatic failure until the chart can be fully evaluated.)

## Artifact Evaluated

[Plotting interface](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/basic.html#ug-basic). Specifically, evaluating the interfaces for all [charts](https://quansight-labs.github.io/bokeh-a11y-audit/#_ts1723552414769) in our test environment: line, bar, table and scatter plot.

<!-- ## Notes
A seasoned SR (screen reader) user could have the knowledge to navigate and explore webpages and graphs with more nuance, whether through manual mode switching, certain key shortcuts, etc. These tests are done by a sighted user with the SRâ€™s default options and performed as if a new or beginner user is interacting with these elements. We would expect that all users could be able to navigate smoothly, regardless of experience levels.  -->
