# Contrast Texture Adjustments

## Test Type Performed

Contrast and textures can be adjusted.

## Artifact Evaluated

[Plotting interface](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/basic.html#ug-basic). Specifically, evaluating the interfaces for all [charts](https://quansight-labs.github.io/bokeh-a11y-audit/#_ts1723552414769) in our test environment: line, bar, table and scatter plot.

## Results Summary

Plotting interface fails to respect a user's custom changing of contrast and/or textures. The chart forms a "box" that retains it's default coloring.

## Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)

- _FAIL_ - Contrast or textures must provide a way to be adjusted as-needed. Chart must not interfere with or override userâ€™s independent contrast adjustments and chart must adjust accordingly to new settings. Chart textures (such as those used on fills) must be able to be turned on or off according to user preference.

Using Windows contrast themes, choose Night Sky (high contrast) option and apply.
