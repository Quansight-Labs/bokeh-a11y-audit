# Information Complexity

## Test Type Performed

Information complexity is appropriate.

## Artifact Evaluated

[Plotting interface](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/basic.html#ug-basic). Specifically, evaluating the interfaces for all [charts](https://quansight-labs.github.io/bokeh-a11y-audit/#_ts1723552414769) in our test environment: line, bar, table and scatter plot.

## Results Summary

Plotting interface fails for the scatter plot and bar chart.

Scatter plot: While the chart's sub-view passes (figure 2), the default view could fail because the encoded categories are hard to tell apart (figure 1). This creates more complexity.

Bar chart: The lack of spacing for the bars in the chart create complexity.

## Expected Behavior (Pass/Fail)

- _FAIL_ - Information complexity must be appropriate to the task or goal of the visual. Often, this is an issue when charts have too many different kinds of information encoded (note that this isn't the same as density). Chart must not have more than one Y or X axis without first presenting two charts separately. Chart must not encode along a third spatial dimension (z axis) unless the data itself is 3D (spatial, modeling, etc). Chart should not contain more than 5 data categories.

    <figcaption>A bar chart is shown. A red box is highlighting two bars that are side-by-side and the same color. There is no spacing be tween the two, making it almost appear as one large bar (this is both a perceptual issue due to lack of differentiation as well as an information complexity issue for making it hard to meaningfully create visual categorization). Also, this chart is encoding color and height redundantly for the value of a category, which is may cause confusion for being an unconventional dual encoding.</figcaption>

## Steps to Reproduce

For Scatter:
Using the scatter plot's tab setting, first view the chart in default view. Next, go to the "Selected Species" tab and choose a drop-down option.

Examine all charts:

- Check that each important piece of information can be easily and accurately discerned from one another
- check that groupings, categories, trends, and patterns can be discerned and interpreted easily
- Check whether any complexity can be reduced without loss of accessibility or understanding (think of this as "complexity-to-ink ratio" in a similar way as Tufte's data-to-ink ratio)
